Install CM Coupon Listing is very easy, just like installing any other Joomla! extension.

We strongly recommend to backup your site before installing any new extension on your site.

Log into your Joomla! back-end. On the top menu, you navigate to Extensions -> Manage to access Extension Manager. Click "Browse" button and select the package of CM Coupon Listing that you downloaded from our website, click "Upload & Install" button to upload the package to your server to install.

If the installation is successful, you will receive the message "Installing package was successful."

To upgrade CM Coupon Listing, you just need to install the package of the new version. Please note that when you upgrade, all the files of CM Coupon Listing will be overwritten, so if you have customized CM Coupon Listing's source code, your customizations will be lost.
